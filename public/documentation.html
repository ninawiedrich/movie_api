    <h1>MovieMaven</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the MovieMaven API. This API is designed as the server-side
      component of a web application that provides users with access to
      information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users can sign
      up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite
      movies. This API is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and
      Node.js) stack and serves as a REST API for the MovieMaven application.
    </p>

    <h2>API Capabilities</h2>
    <p>
      The MovieMaven API allows for a range of operations such as returning a
      list of all movies, providing data about a single movie, a genre, or a
      director, as well as allowing new users to register and existing users to
      update their profile, add/remove movies to/from their list of favorites,
      and deregister. The API uses commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST
      and leverages CRUD operations to interact with the database.
    </p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
      To interact with this API, you will need to have Node.js and MongoDB
      installed. Follow the steps in our setup guide to get started with your
      development environment.
